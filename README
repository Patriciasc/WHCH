What Is 'WHCH?'
WHCH stands for "Working Hours Counter for Humans".

This is an application for tracking the time spent on
individual projects.

       WHCH is an Open Source project, Free Software released under the
       GNU General Public License (GPL). It is free, and the 'source code'
       behind the program is available. (This allows others to add features,

                                Using WHCH

How To Use 'WHCH?'

Step 1.
Add new clients or tasks associated with clients under "Task->Add new task"
in the main window or from the top menu under "Settings->Clients and tasks".

Step 2. 
Click on "Start" button to  indicate that you are going to start a task and
go on working on the task.

Step 3. 
When finished with the current task, select a task from the "Task" list in
the main window.

Step 4.
Write a detailed description in the "Details" field in the main window for the
task you were working on.

Step 5. 
Click on "Stop" button and the task will be shown in the main window and saved
automatically. Edition of start/end time and details is possible by clicking
on those fields.
